Problem Statement: 

E-waste continues to be a challenge among households. There are no proper structures and procedures in the available garbage collection system on how to specifically collect e-wastes. Kenyan households do not find it easy to dispose off their 'not working' electronics together with other household wastes eg kitchen wastes.  


Solution Statement:
A user friendly application would be ideal to help address this problem. It will make it easy for households to order for (collection of e-waste). The users will be able to add the items e-waste items as well as detailed specifications that will allow the collector to go and pick the items. The app will have specific slots for dates  that collection would happen. 

Project Features: 

2. Item details
-The user identifies the e-waste item by name and classification eg: 
gadgets, kitchenware etc


3. Location of the household

1. Personal Bio information and Contact information: 
- Phone number to aid further in direction giving (finer direction details like landmarks)

4. Collection dates: 
- I propose specification of dates to allow for feasible and economically sensitive collection.
-  Users also pick dates that are most suitable for them. 
-

5. Blank field for additional information 
- Users can add details they feel are not captured in the form/ fill-up above. 
- This will be typed and captures anything the user feels is finer and aids in customization.
